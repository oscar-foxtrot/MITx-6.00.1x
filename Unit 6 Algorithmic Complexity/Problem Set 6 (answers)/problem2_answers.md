Answer:   
##### FALSE    
Explanation: Indirection is about accessing variables through other variables.  
<br />
<br />
2-2. The complexity of binary search on a sorted list of n items is O(log(n)).       
Answer:     
##### TRUE  
Explanation: Indeed, the complexity of binary search on a sorted list of n items is O(log(n))  
<br />
<br />
2-3. The worst case time complexity for selection sort is O(n^2).      
Answer:   
##### TRUE    
Explanation: It is not just the worst case. The average case for selection sort is also O(n^2). Best case is also O(n^2).  
<br />
<br />
2-4. The base case for the recursive version of merge sort from lecture is checking ONLY for the list being empty.  
Answer:    
##### FALSE   
Explanation: The algorithm from the lecture checks whether or not the length of the list is less than 2 (empty or of length 1)
