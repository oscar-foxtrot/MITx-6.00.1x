1-1. The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer:  
Answer: ### FALSE  
Explanation: it is better for us if the program doesn't just return the correct answer, but rather does it quickly (we are interested in optimization)
...
1-2. When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest growth rate.  
Answer: ### TRUE
Explanation: it is stated in the lecture. Also it is obvious if you've encountered so-called "limits" in calculus.
...
1-3. Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity
Answer: ### FALSE
Explanation: No, bisection search has the complexity of O(log(n))
...
1-4. For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps
Answer: ### TRUE
Explanation: The first mentioned algorithm has the complexity of O(n^2) while the latter has the complexity of O(n^5) (fist is better)
